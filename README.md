# Spotify Analysis Project

It is the term project of my CS 210 course.

## Setup

### Python

This code is written in the Python programming language.

While versions of Python may come with your OS, I used [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the latest version.

This README assumes the latest version of your Python install is run using `python`

### Clone this repository

'gh repo clone egecangar/my_spotify_exploration'

### Install the Spotipy library

Install the client for the Spotify Web API for Python:

`pip install spotipy`


### Install the scikit-learn libraries

If you want to make calculations on Machine Learning:

`pip install scikit-learn`


`pip install scikit-learn matplotlib`

### Setup your credentials file

Create a file called `credentials.config`

Go to the [Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create an app.

Then add the following lines to `credentials.config`

```
[DEFAULT]
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = xxx
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = yyy
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = https://example.com/callback
```
```
[My Account]
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 00dbc84838e6422e994c8adaf6d2599c
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = e0412c081983415dbc9319504104b220
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = http://localhost:8788/callback
```
### Add a refresh token to your config file

Then add a refresh token to the config file by running

`python get_refresh_token.py`

You'll then see in your `credentials.config` the added line

`SPOTIFY_USER_REFRESH = aaa`
